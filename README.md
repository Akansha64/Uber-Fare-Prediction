# Uber-Fare-Prediction
Problem Statement :- This case study is to predict the price of the Uber ride from a
given pickup point to the agreed dropoff location. Evaluating the models & comparing
their respective scores RMSE

Introduction:- The project is about the world's largest taxi company Uber inc. In this
project, we're looking to predict the fare for their future transactional cases. Uber
delivers service to lakhs of customers daily. Now it becomes really important to manage
their data properly to come up with new business ideas to get best results. Eventually, it
becomes really important to estimate the fare prices accurately according to the
distance, and time

Conclusion:
Our Uber Fare Prediction model has been trained and evaluated using
three different regression models: Random Forest, Multiple Regression, and ElasticNet
Regression. Based on our model training, we have found that the Random Forest and
Multiple Regression models provide better accuracy than the ElasticNet Regression
model in predicting Uber fares. This suggests that the Random Forest and Multiple
Regression models are better suited to our problem domain and are more effective in
capturing the complexities of the dataset. These models may be more useful in
real-world applications, as they can more accurately predict Uber fares for different
scenarios and help users make informed decisions about their travel plans.
Overall, the results of our model training demonstrate the importance of selecting the
right machine learning algorithm for the task at hand and the value of thorough
experimentation and evaluation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our models.
